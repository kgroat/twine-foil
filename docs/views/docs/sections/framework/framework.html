  Foil comes with some built-in scripts known as framework scripts.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the framework scripts defined by Foil, some <a href="#docs/plugins">plugins</a> may define new ones for you to use.
</p>
<p>
  You can tell that a script is a framework script because it doesn't begin with the same './' that custom scripts do.  For example, to get the story framework script, you would do the following:
</p>
<div class="example no-result">
  var story = require('story');
</div>
