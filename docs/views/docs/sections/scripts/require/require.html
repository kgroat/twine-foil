<p>
  The <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1">CommonJS module specification</a> also defines a function called 'require'.
</p>
<p>
  This require function is how you gain access to other scripts.  All of your custom-defined scripts will need to be preceded with './' when getting them using the require() function.
</p>
<p>
  If you have a script that you called 'characterService' for instance, you could access it in the following way:
</p>
<div class="example no-result">
  var characterService = require('./characterService');
  var john = characterService.get('john');
</div>
