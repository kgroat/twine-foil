  The first thing you'll need to do to get started is add Foil as a Story Format to Twine 2.  To do this, you'll need to follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1)</strong> From your stories page, on the right side of the page, click the link labelled "Formats".
</p>
<img class="image-icon" src="/home-formats.png" alt="The Formats link from the stories page" />
<p />
<p>
  <strong>2)</strong> In the menu that pops up, click the rightmost tab labelled "Add a New Format" and enter the following url:
  <div class="copy"><input readonly class="copy-target" value="https://twine-foil.herokuapp.com/dist/format.js" style="width:300px"/><span class="after">Click to copy</span></div>
</p>
<img class="image-icon" src="/formats-add.png" alt="Adding the format to Twine 2" />
<p />
<p>
  <strong>3)</strong> Click the "+ Add" button.
</p>
<p>
  You now have Foil installed in Twine 2.  You can verify this by returning to the leftmost tab in the Formats menu, labelled "Story Formats" and making sure that Foil appears there.
