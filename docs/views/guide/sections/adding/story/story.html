  The next thing you'll want to do is set a story to use the Foil format.  To do this, you'll need to have a story created and then follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1)</strong> While editing the story, open the story menu by clicking on the story's name in the lower-left-hand corner of the screen.
</p>
<img class="image-icon" src="/story-menu.png" alt="The Story menu of Twine 2" />
<p />
<p>
  <strong>2)</strong> From this menu, you will want to click the "Change Story Format" option.  This should bring up a menu called "Story Format".
</p>
<img class="image-icon" src="/format-select.png" alt="Story Format menu to select which format you want to use" />
<p />
<p>
  <strong>3)</strong> From this menu, click the square to the left of the Foil format and close the menu.
</p>
<p>
  Your Tine 2 story is now using the Foil format.  You can now utilize all of the features of Foil from within your story.
